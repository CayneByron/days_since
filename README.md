<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A very simple note taking app with a small twist. I kept finding that I couldn't remember how long ago the last time I had performed certain tasks. For example:

* The last time I had changed my razorblade.
* The last time I had a haircut
* The last time I cleaned the house
